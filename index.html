                                    THE PROVERBIAL EXPRESSION ‘MODERN PROBLEMS REQUIRE MODERN SOLUTIONS’ IS A FITTING DESCRIPTION FOR THE FACE OF 21ST CENTURY INNOVATIONS. BUT THIS CAN SOMETIMES BE HIT-OR-MISS. THE SHOCK VALUE OF UNVEILING AN INNOVATION IS NOT ENOUGH TO GUARANTEE ITS SUCCESS.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BY LOOKING INTO THE PHILOSOPHIES BEHIND SUCCESSFUL CREATIVE SOLUTIONS, WE UNRAVELED THE FORMULA THAT BEST SUITS OUR DEPICTION OF A GOOD TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: DECONSTRUCTION, DECENTRALIZATION, AND DEMOCRATIZATION. DECONSTRUCTION IS AN OVERARCHING IDEA THAT SEEKS TO CHALLENGE THE PRODUCTION OF OLD WAYS AND RECONSTRUCT NEW ONES. WITH DECENTRALIZATION, THE GOAL IS TO BECOME INDEPENDENT FROM AUTHORITY. FINALLY, DEMOCRATIZATION CELEBRATES FREEDOM AND ACCESS. WHEN COMBINED, THESE THREE FORMS OF DISRUPTION CAN SERVE AS STRONG PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR AN IDEAL 21ST-CENTURY INNOVATION.
                                    <br><br>
                                    THE GOAL IS, THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE UNITY IN ENCOMPASSING THIS TRINITY OF CONCEPTS: DECONSTRUCT SYSTEMS. DECENTRALIZE POWER. DEMOCRATIZE KNOWLEDGE
                                    <br><br>
                                    LET’S LOOK AT THESE CONCEPTS MORE CLOSELY.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>DECONSTRUCTING SYSTEMS.</b>
                                    <br><br>
                                    THE IDEA OF DESTRUCTION IS OFTEN SEEN AS A NEGATIVE EVENT. IT CONNOTES THE DEATH OF PRE- ESTABLISHED STRUCTURES. A DESTRUCTION OF A BUILDING ENTAILS THE LOSS OF ALL RESOURCES, PLANNING, AND EFFORTS THAT WERE PUT INTO THE VERY ACT OF BUILDING IT, TO BEGIN WITH. IT IS PERCEIVED AS THE DIRECT ANTAGONIST OF CREATION. WHEN THE LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA WAS TORN INTO PIECES, CENTURIES’ WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE WAS DESTROYED ALONG WITH IT. SIMILARLY, THE DESTRUCTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES PROMPTED THE EMERGENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
                                    <br><br>
                                    DESTRUCTION, GENERALLY SPEAKING, CAN BE CATASTROPHIC.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BUT PERHAPS, THIS MANNER OF THINKING IS SIMPLY A PRODUCT OF CONVENTION AND COULD, IN PRINCIPLE, BE UNLEARNED – OR BETTER YET – CONTESTED. A FRENCH PHILOSOPHER BY THE NAME OF JACQUES DERRIDA INTRODUCED THE IDEA OF DECONSTRUCTION AS A DISRUPTION TO THE CONVENTIONAL WAYS OF SEEING THINGS – A BREAK FROM THE OLD-FASHIONED BINARY MODES OF THINKING.1 FOR THE
                                    <br><br>
                                    LONGEST TIME, WE HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE CONCEPT OF PUTTING THINGS INTO BINARY OPPOSITIONS OR DUALITIES. WE UNDERSTAND LOVE IN TERMS OF HOW IT OPPOSES HATE, TEXT AS IT OPPOSES SPEECH, MAN AS IT OPPOSES WOMAN, REASON AS IT OPPOSES EMOTION, AND CREATION AS IT OPPOSES DESTRUCTION. OFTEN, THESE BINARY OPPOSITIONS, OR DUALITIES, CARRY WITH THEM AN UNNECESSARY HIERARCHY – WHERE ONE IS SUPERIOR, AND THE OTHER, INFERIOR: LOVE AS BEING BETTER THAN HATE, TEXT AS MORE PRIVILEGED THAN SPEECH, MAN AS BEING BETTER THAN WOMAN, REASON AS BEING STRONGER THAN EMOTION, AND CREATION AS BEING SUPERIOR TO DESTRUCTION.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THESE BINARY OPPOSITIONS TEND TO CREATE MORE BOXES FOR US TO PUT OUR CONVENTIONAL METHODS INTO. DECONSTRUCTION DEVIATES FROM THIS VERY TRADITION.
                                    <br><br>
                                    AS A PHILOSOPHY, DECONSTRUCTION REDEFINES THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE WORLD. WE NO LONGER SEE TEXT AS BEING SUPERIOR TO SPEECH2; A REVOLUTION FOR THE EQUALITY OF THE SEXES IS ONGOING AS WE SPEAK; AND GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN EMOTION IS PERCEIVED AS IRRELEVANT TO SOCIETAL RELATIONSHIPS. PERHAPS, THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN CREATION AND DESTRUCTION. PERHAPS, RATHER THAN SEEING CREATION AND DESTRUCTION AS POLAR OPPOSITES, THEY CAN BE SEEN AS COOPERATIVE COMPONENTS IN A MORE HOLISTIC AND HARMONIOUS PROCESS.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BUT THIS BREAKING OF BINARY OPPOSITIONS IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP IN THE DECONSTRUCTIVE METHOD. THE REASON WHY WE WANT TO BREAK THESE BINARIES IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT STRUCTURES ARE NOT SET IN STONE AND THAT, IN FACT, THEY CAN BE BROKEN. LOVE AND HATE CAN BE CONTRADICTORY, BUT THEY CAN JUST AS EASILY CO-EXIST AS A HUMAN EMOTION. MAN AND WOMAN MAY NOT BE EQUAL IN ALL RESPECTS, BUT THEY ARE NOT FIXED WITHIN PREDETERMINED ROLES. BREAKING THESE DUALITIES ENTAILS THAT WE CAN DISASSEMBLE THE STRUCTURE AND REASSEMBLE THEM TO FORM A NEW ONE – ONE THAT WORKS. THE STRUCTURES, IN SHORT, ARE NEVER FIXED.
                                    <br><br>
                                    THIS NOTION THAT STRUCTURES ARE NOT SET IN STONE AND CAN, THEREFORE, BE BROKEN INTO PIECES IS VISIBLE IN SEVERAL INDUSTRIES TODAY. IN GAMING, THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) TECHNOLOGY ALLOWED PLAYERS TO FULLY INTERACT WITH THE FICTIONAL COMPONENTS EMBEDDED WITHIN A GAME. NO LONGER DO WE SEE A FIXED OPPOSITION BETWEEN REALITY AND FICTION, AS SUCH TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATES; ON THE CONTRARY, WE SEE THEM INTERMINGLE WITH EACH OTHER.
                                    <br><br>
                                    THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN BIG AND SMALL MACHINES, WHERE THE ‘BIGGER IS BETTER’ SLOGAN SEEMED TO HAVE ORIGINATED IS ALSO EVIDENTLY CHALLENGED. SMARTPHONE COMPANIES APPEAR TO BE AIMING FOR MORE MINIMALIST AND COMPACT MECHANISMS TO SELL IN THE MARKET. AND EVEN IN HEALTHCARE, NANOTECHNOLOGY REINFORCES THE IDEA THAT TINY INVENTIONS CAN GENERATE GIGANTIC IMPACTS.
                                    <br><br>
                                    THESE SUCCESSES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A COURAGEOUS VENTURING INTO A DESTRUCTION OF PRE-ESTABLISHED STRUCTURES. THE KEY IS TO START DECONSTRUCTING SYSTEMS.
